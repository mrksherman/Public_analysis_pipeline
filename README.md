This repository is used to highlight scripts generated based on my work at the University of Texas at Austin and small, publicly available projects since that time.

Example scripts include:
|Script | Description|
|:-:|:-:|
|Motif_Search | Performs regular expression search across bacetrial transcriptomes to extract contextual information |
|tna_Library_Analysis | Takes variant frequencies in a starting library along with pooled screening data to generate a report for easy interpretation of enrichment following selection|
|RNA_structure_seq_workflow| Takes RNA mutational mapping data and generates report to assess nucleotide-calling prediction|
